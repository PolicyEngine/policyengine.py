# Simulation

The `Simulation` class is the main interface under `policyengine`. It lets you define a simulation (either of a single policy or a factual-counterfactual pair) and run it.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: policyengine.Simulation
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
    :inherited-members:
    :exclude-members: __init__
    :special-members: __init__
```
