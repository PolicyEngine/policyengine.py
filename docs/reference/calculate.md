# Calculate

The `Simulation.calculate` function is the most important function in the `Simulation` class. Think of initialising the `Simulation` class as setting up the world model (with assumptions and data specified), and `calculate` as asking it a question (we refer to this as an `endpoint`).

Generally, you call `calculate('folder/structure/question')`, with the questions being organised in a folder structure that makes sense. For example, we might call `Simulation.calculate('macro/comparison/budget/general/tax_revenue_impact')` to ask the model to calculate the impact of a tax revenue change on the budget.

The set of possible questions depends on the parameters of the `Simulation` you've defined. For example, if you set up a simulation with household data describing a person who earns Â£30,000 a year, you can't ask it for the budgetary impact of a reform, but you can ask it for the change to that person's net income. If you set up a simulation from PolicyEngine's survey data, you can ask it for the impact of a policy on the distribution of income, but you can't ask "how does this reform affect this person's net income?".

This page contains a list of all the questions you can ask the model, organised by folder structure. Under each one, we add the description, output type, and conditions under which you can ask that question.

To reduce duplication, we've organised them into four categories, by the type of simulation you're running:

* Single macro: simulations of a single policy on a large survey dataset. e.g. "What is the poverty rate?"
* Comparison macro: simulations of two policies (and the effect of comparing them) on a large survey dataset. e.g. "How much revenue would this policy raise?"
* Single household: simulations of a single policy on a single household. e.g. "What is my net income?"
* Comparison household: simulations of two policies (and the effect of comparing them) on a single household. e.g. "How much better off would I be under this policy?"
