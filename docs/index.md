# policyengine.py

This package aims to simplify and productionise the use of PolicyEngine's tax-benefit microsimulation models to flexibly produce useful information at scale, slotting into existing analysis pipelines while also standardising analysis.

We do this by:
* Standardising around a set of core types that let us do policy analysis in an object-oriented way
* Provide a nice clean interface to put instances of these types in a database
* Exemplifying this behaviour by using this package in all PolicyEngine's production applications, and analyses

In this documentation, we'll walk through the core concepts/types that this package makes available, and how you can use them to run policy analyses at scale.
